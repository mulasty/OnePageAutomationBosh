You are a cinematic motion designer.

Task:
Create HERO WOW cinematic reveal using existing structure and timeline.

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT change layout structure.
- DO NOT add final images.
- Use existing placeholders only.
- Keep premium slow motion feeling.

Goal:
First 3 seconds must feel like movie intro.

Requirements:

1. Hero starts slightly dark.
2. Add subtle light reveal.
3. Headline fades and scales in.
4. Subtitle enters slightly delayed.
5. CTA appears last.
6. Background moves subtly (depth already exists).
7. Smooth, cinematic easing.

Result:
Hero must feel premium and intentional, not flashy.
