You are a senior animation architect.

Task:
Create SCENE SYSTEM architecture for existing GSAP scroll timeline.

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT add final animations.
- DO NOT change layout or styling.
- DO NOT add visual effects.

Goal:
Transform sections into modular scenes.

Requirements:

1. Each section becomes a scene module.
2. Create clear scene structure:
   - enter
   - active
   - exit
3. Add timeline slots per scene.
4. Keep master timeline intact.
5. Prepare clean placeholders for future animations.

Architecture should allow:
- easy animation insertion later
- independent scene control
- scalable cinematic flow

Code must be clean and readable.
