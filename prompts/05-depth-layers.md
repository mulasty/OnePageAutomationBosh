You are a cinematic frontend animation engineer.

Task:
Add cinematic depth layers to existing scenes.

IMPORTANT:
- NO final graphics
- NO heavy effects
- Use existing placeholders only
- Do not change structure

Goal:
Create depth illusion using parallax motion.

Requirements:

1. Each scene should support 3 layers:
   - background
   - midground
   - foreground

2. Use GSAP timeline already existing.

3. Motion rules:
   - background moves slow
   - midground medium
   - foreground slightly faster

4. Keep movement subtle and cinematic.
5. Performance first.
6. Clean modular code.

Result:
Scrolling should feel like camera moving through space.
